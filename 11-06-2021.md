Tech To-Do
- [X] Solve Array problems from GFG
- [X] Record and upload identity operator video lesson
- [ ] Take up one issue from AutSpaces open source 

- At the start of the day solved 2 level 1 array problems from GFG top 50 array problems. First problem was to divide the array into equal sized segments and then in each segment check if number k is present or not. If number is present return YES otherwise NO. Broke down the problem into small parts wrote it on pen paper in plain english. Then wrote peusdocode for each part and then went on to the editor. I was able to come up with a O(n) solution without seeing the solution. Second problem was to find the maximum and minimum element present in the array. Instinctive approach was to solve using built-in min() and max() methods. Solved the problem both ways using built-in method and without using built-in methods. 
 
- Whole afternoon got wasted. During evening got myself assigned the first issue in the AutSpaces project to work on. Experiencing resistance before I start doing it need to get over it this time. In the past I have paid the price for this already. Part of experiencing this I think is because of lack of confidence. Only way now to build confidence is to not resist, start doing and figure it out on the way. Tomorrow I'll make sure to eat this frog first.

- Came across an open source internship opening at Quansight, applied.

- Recorded and uploaded Identity operator video again with improved examples and updated the description. The updates are not yet visible on the platform so I need to keep following up.

- Followed up with both clients and resolved the tax related confusions. :)
