- did 40 minutes yoga twice morning and then in evening along with meditation 10 minutes. During the initial days it was really difficult to not let the mind wander. While doing one exercise mind used to think of next exercise or something else work/life etc. The process is slow but eventually learning to focus on the current activity and task at hand. Balance has improved in almost all exercises. Doing 10 minutes medidation with closed eyes and no racing thoughts was a challenge for quite sometime. 10 minutes now seems alright, going ahead I'll try to increase the meditation time.  

- Solved 1 Hackerrank problem based on arrays - Grading Students. It took one hour to think through the logic and write the code. Was able to come up with the logic on my own which was satisfying. All the test cases passed. By the end of day will try solving some more problems. Solved the problem mathematically used pen and paper first, then wrote the pseudocode.


Things that are taking headspace these days:

- it has been really tough to keep applying for interviews, and reading those rejection emails saying "Sorry to inform you, we have found a better candidate than you". It is has been more than a year and a half now. Things were taking toll before as well, they are taking toll now as well. Its like every time you pick yourself up. You get bogged down. Maybe someday would be a brighter day than ongoing tough times. Mid of the pandemic and rejections. üòï

- I get irritated and frustated too fast. I think the root cause is the job stress and failure. Appetite for anykind of BS is reduced. 

Gratitude:

- Health wise me and the family is doing alright.
- Grateful to be able monetize teaching that I was doing for FREE for last 2 years.
- It has taken consious effort but I am able to control myself and don't engage in anykind of negative social media comments. And, any kind of comments/ideologies that I disagree with. This has bought some level of peace of mind.
- I have been able to control myself and don't hop onto facebook anymore. Glad about the fact that I never had an account on Instagram. 

Things to achieve:
- No social media engagement, no doomscrolling. 
- Calm mind
- No frustation, stoic approach.
- Need to learn to focus on input rather than on outcome. Input is within control, and output is not.

What I am optimizing for?
- Optimizing for fun and Happiness.
